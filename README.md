# A* Search Algorithm C++ Implementation
A* is an efficient search algorithm  used in many fields. Learn more about this algorithm on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm .
This project is a sample C++ implementation of the algorithm. Given a 2D grid, start point, and a goal point, the algorithm generates a path connecting the two points and avoiding the obstacles. //TODO
